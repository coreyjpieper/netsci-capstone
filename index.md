# Mapping Macalester's Majors

### Introduction

One of the defining characteristics of a liberal arts curriculum is the emphasis in taking classes from a variety of subjects. At Macalester College, some courses are cross-listed between disciplines to show they draw on material from multiple departments, and students are known to juggle multiple majors and minors. These connections and interrelations between subjects provide a prime opportunity to study them through a network science perspective. In the following analysis we will examine the areas of study at Macalester through two separate networks: 1) a network of cross-listed courses over a four semester period from fall 2018 to spring 2020, and 2) a network of double majors/minors/concentrations using data from the class of 2020.
